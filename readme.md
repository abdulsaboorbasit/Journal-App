# Journal App
This Journal App is a simple, console-based application where users can record their daily thoughts or goals. Each entry is stored in a list, and the most recent entry is displayed after each addition. The project is designed for Python beginners to practice basic programming concepts such as variables, strings, lists, and user input.

## Features
1. Add Journal Entries: Users can type new journal entries, which will be stored in a list.
2. Display Latest Entry: After each new entry, the app displays the latest entry to confirm it was saved.
3. Exit Option: Users can type "quit" to exit the program and see a summary of all their entries.
## Requirements
Python 3.x
## Getting Started
